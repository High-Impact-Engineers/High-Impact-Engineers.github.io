# High Impact Engineers

ðŸš§ under construction as of December 2024 ðŸš§

## about

This is the repo for the [High Impact Engineers website](https://high-impact-engineers.github.io/).

## why is the website here now?

In 2024 High Impact Engineers lost continuous funding. As a result it is now [completely volunteer-run](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kqQgSj3eyBM5D8B2P/high-impact-engineers-is-transitioning-to-a-volunteer-led). Keeping the website here

- keeps costs down
- makes handovers easy as volunteers will inevitably come and go depending on what capacity they have at any point in time
