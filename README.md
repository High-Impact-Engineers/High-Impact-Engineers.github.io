# High Impact Engineers

ðŸš§ under construction as of December 2024 ðŸš§

## about

This is the repo for the [High Impact Engineers website](https://high-impact-engineers.github.io/).

## why is the website here now?

In 2024 High Impact Engineers lost continuous funding. As a result it is now [completely volunteer-run](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kqQgSj3eyBM5D8B2P/high-impact-engineers-is-transitioning-to-a-volunteer-led). Keeping the website here

- keeps costs down
- makes handovers easy as volunteers will inevitably come and go depending on what capacity they have at any point in time

This website is based on the original website. It was built by [Amanda Matthes](https://amanda-matthes.github.io/). If you want to contribute, shoot them a message.

## local dev setup

Install Ruby (and the development kit).

Once, run:

``` bash
gem i bundler first
```

To install missing gems, run:

``` bash
bundle install
```

To build the website locally, run:

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The website should then be accessible at:

``` bash
http://localhost:4000/
```

It will be regenerated every time you save a new change in a markdown file.
