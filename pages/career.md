You will probably spend about 80,000 hours working. That makes your career one of the biggest ways you can have a positive impact.

## Got a specific question or want to talk to someone about your career?

You can join the `role-physical-engineers` channel on the [EA Anywhere Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/eavirtualmeetupgroup/shared_invite/zt-nnm9fyfp-kPS1R98d~SW5soPRcfegoQ). If you share your question there and someone might be happy to chat! High Impact Engineers is currently not funded, so sadly we can't guarantee that someone will have time.
